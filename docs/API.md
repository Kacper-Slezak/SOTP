# SOTP API Documentation

## Primary Documentation Source (Live & Interactive)

The primary source of truth for the SOTP API is the **auto-generated, interactive documentation** provided by the FastAPI framework.

This documentation is available on your local development environment at the following URL:

### [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

An alternative documentation view (ReDoc) is also available at:

### [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## Why Use the Interactive Docs?

* **Always Up-to-Date:** The documentation is generated directly from the Python source code, so it can never be out of sync with the actual API.
* **Interactive:** You can try out every API endpoint directly from your browser, sending real requests to your local application and seeing live responses.
* **Detailed:** It includes precise information about request models, response formats, validation errors, and security requirements for each endpoint.

This static `API.md` file serves only as a high-level pointer to the live documentation. Please refer to the `/docs` endpoint for all technical details regarding the API.
