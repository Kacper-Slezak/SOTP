# SOTP System Requirements

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the System Observability & Telemetry Platform (SOTP).

## 1. Functional Requirements

These requirements describe the specific features and capabilities the system must provide to the user.

### 1.1. Device Management
* **CRUD Operations:** The system must provide full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for network devices.
* **Device Inventory:** Users must be able to view a list of all monitored devices with key information (name, IP, status).

### 1.2. Monitoring
* **ICMP Monitoring:** The system must be able to monitor device availability and latency using ICMP (ping).
* **SNMP Monitoring:** The system must support monitoring of device metrics (CPU, memory, interface traffic) via the SNMP protocol.
* **SSH Command Execution:** The system must allow authorized users to execute predefined, read-only commands on devices via SSH.

### 1.3. Alerting
* **Rule-Based Alerts:** The system must allow users to define alert rules based on metric thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%).
* **Notification Channels:** The system must be able to send alert notifications via Email, Slack, and generic Webhooks.

### 1.4. Authentication & Authorization
* **User Accounts:** The system must support user registration and login.
* **JWT-Based Authentication:** All API endpoints must be secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system must support different user roles (e.g., Admin, Operator) with varying permissions.

### 1.5. Audit Logging
* **Action Tracking:** The system must log all critical user actions, such as creating a device, changing a setting, or executing a command.

### 1.6. Reporting
* **Report Generation:** The system must be able to generate summary reports (e.g., availability, performance) in CSV and PDF formats.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements describe the quality attributes and constraints of the system.

### 2.1. Performance
* **Scalability:** The system must be capable of monitoring at least 1,000 devices with a polling interval of 30 seconds.
* **API Response Time:** The p95 response time for all API endpoints should be under 200ms.

### 2.2. Availability
* **Uptime:** The system must maintain an uptime of 99.5% or higher.

### 2.3. Security
* **OWASP Top 10:** The application must be compliant with OWASP Top 10 security recommendations.
* **Secrets Management:** All sensitive data (passwords, keys) must be stored securely in HashiCorp Vault.

### 2.4. Scalability
* **Horizontal Scaling:** The architecture must allow for horizontal scaling of collector and application workers to handle increased load.

### 2.5. Backup & Recovery
* **Automated Backups:** The system must perform automated daily backups of all critical data.
* **Data Retention:** Backups must be retained for at least 30 days.
